        <p>Stanley Tucci is an American actor and filmmaker known for his role in <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> and as host of <i>Stanley Tucci: Searching For Italy.</i> Recently, I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Taste-My-Life-Through-Food/dp/1982168013">his memoir that covers how food has influenced his life</a> from birth to present day. I loved how he incorporated authentic Italian recipes with emotive anecdotes. After reading the book, I tried the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio recipe, and it was delicious. I'd reccommend this book to anyone who is looking for a comforting read that will leave them hungry for more! </p>

        <p><i>"A delicious story of appetite, family, and pasta. A serious amount of pasta. In this gloriously written memoir, the ever tasteful Stanley Tucci invites us to his table and feeds us all the good stuff."</i></p>
